# Basic C++ Programs

This repository contains simple C++ programs to help you get started with basic programming concepts. Included are:

1. A "Hello, World!" program.
2. A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Below, you'll find detailed explanations of the logic behind each program.

## Introduction

These programs are designed to introduce fundamental concepts in C++ programming. The "Hello, World!" program demonstrates basic output, while the basic calculator shows how to perform arithmetic operations and handle user input.

## Program 1: Hello, World!

### Logic Explanation

This program is the classic first program for any new programming language. It demonstrates how to output text to the console. The logic involves:

1. **Include the iostream Library**: This library is used for input and output operations.
2. **Main Function**: The entry point of the program where execution starts.
3. **Print to Console**: The `std::cout` object is used to print "Hello, World!" to the console.
4. **Return Statement**: The `return 0;` statement indicates that the program has executed successfully.

## Program 2: Basic Calculator

### Logic Explanation

This program performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The steps are:

1. **Include the iostream Library**: Required for input and output operations.
2. **Main Function**: The entry point of the program.
3. **User Input**: The user is prompted to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
4. **Perform Calculation**: Based on the user's choice, the appropriate arithmetic operation is performed.
5. **Display Result**: The result of the calculation is displayed to the user.
6. **Handle Division by Zero**: The program checks for division by zero to prevent errors.
